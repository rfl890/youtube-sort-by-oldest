Sort a YouTube channel's videos by oldest

YouTube has recently removed the option to sort by oldest, (pointless if you ask me), so I built this application to sort all of a channel's videos by oldest.    
This is a project I made for myself (hence the weird api key thing, instead of using a backend), I put up the site if some people who are experienced and/or already have an api key want to use it, and made a tutorial for users who want to go to that length.
