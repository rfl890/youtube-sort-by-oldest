Sort a YouTube channel's videos by oldest

YouTube has recently removed the option to sort by oldest, (pointless if you ask me), so I built this application to sort all of a channel's videos by oldest. 
This is a project I made for myself (hence the weird api key thing, instead of using a backend), I put up the site and made a tutorial for those who experienced and/or already have an api key, or users who want to go to that length.
